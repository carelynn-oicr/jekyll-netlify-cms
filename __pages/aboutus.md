    introduction_subheading1: WHO WE ARE

    introduction_subheading2: WHAT WE DO

    introduction_txt: '**The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre-Ontario Institute for Cancer Research Translational Genomics Lab (PM-OICR TGL)** is a joint collaborative workspace located in the MaRS complex at University Avenue and College Street in downtown Toronto.' 
    
    introduction2_txt: |-
        TGL enhances rapid access to genomics technologies, and facilitates genomic interpretation and reporting in clinical oncology. 
        
        TGL provides research support to the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and affiliated cancer research institutions as part of OICRâ€™s Adaptive Oncology Program. 
        
        TGL is formulated to accelerate clinical oncology research through partnership and drive key initiatives.

    title2_txt: About the Research

    body_txt: >-
        TGL participates in clinical trial research through the [Princess Margaret Cancer Genomics (CGP)](http://www.cancergenomicsprogram.ca/) and [Tumor Immunotherapy Programs (TIP)](http://www.pm-tumorimmunotherapyprogram.ca/), providing extended capabilities and infrastructure. 
        
    project-octane_subheading: PROJECT OCTANE       
    project-octane_txt: >-
        TGL is supporting the [Ontario-wide Targeted Nucleic Acid Evaluation (OCTANE) Trial](http://www.ontario.canadiancancertrials.ca/Trial/Default.aspx?TrialId=NCT02906943&lang=ens"), which is increasing cancer patient access to next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology and rapid informatic analysis in therapeutic management. **OCTANE is establishing large provincial cohorts of consented patients for NGS-based genomic profiling** that may inform the use of approved therapies and identify patients that may benefit from advanced molecular profiling within TGL.
