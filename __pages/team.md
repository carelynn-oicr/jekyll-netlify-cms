      bioTitle_txt: Trevor Pugh, Co-Director
      bioBody_txt: Dr. Pugh is a Scientist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto Department of Medical Biophysics and holds the Canada Research Chair in Translational Genomics. He is Scientific Director of the Princess Margaret Genomics Centre and Director of the PM-OICR Translational Genomics Laboratory, a joint initiative with the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research to enable clinically-oriented cancer genomics research. He also spends a portion of his time as a clinical molecular geneticist supporting test development within the University Health Network Laboratory Medicine Program. His research program is focused on understanding clonal shifts in cancer and non-cancerous cell populations in serial biopsies and circulating tumour DNA collected during treatment. He is also working to decipher subclonal genetic relationships amongst metastatic sites suggestive of effective combination treatments, and to discover oncogenic mechanisms underlying tumours of unknown etiology including breast, brain, neuroendocrine, gynecological, and pediatric cancer.
